VirtualCPU
==========
This was not created by me, however I feel that putting it on Github is much better than on some website that might dissapear in the next year or two.

Here is the original link for those interested: http://megalomaniacbore.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/virtual-cpu-in-c-4001-cpu.html

To compile this project using g++: g++ -std=c++11 -c *.cpp
g++ *.o main
./main
